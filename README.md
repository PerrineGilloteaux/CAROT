# CAROT
Computational Automata for radiotherapy Optimization against Tumor
Companion software for “Optimizing radiotherapy protocols using computer automata to model tumor cell death in function of oxygen diffusion processes.” 

The model presents the advantage to give a visual feedback and to include for the first time as a working assumption the mitotic death as the principal mode of tumor cell death, and allow to study the effect of hypoxia on different dose, based on experimental data. All the parameters of this model, (listed in supplementary Table 1) are physiologically accessible, and have been fitted to experimental data. A stochastic factor is inserted for the initial spatial disposition of cells, vessel and Oxygen map to model the variability in patient/animal.
The code has been developed under Matlab, and requires the DipImages 2.7
